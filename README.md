# CyclistData

This is my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate case study/ project.

The data was sourced from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

(Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license.)

Business Question to be answered:
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
